# CTS-HACKATHON-BRAIN-TUMOR-CLASSIFICATION
Deep learning project for brain tumor detection using MRI scans. Implements CNN, MobileNetV3, VGG16, InceptionV3, and a Hybrid VGG16+InceptionV3 model, achieving up to 93.5% accuracy. Includes preprocessing (Normalization, CLAHE, Augmentation), model training, evaluation, and comparison of architectures.
# üß† Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on **early detection and classification of brain tumors** using **MRI images** with **Deep Learning models**.  
We implemented **CNN, VGG16, InceptionV3, and a Hybrid Model** (VGG16 + InceptionV3) to achieve high accuracy in detecting benign and malignant tumors.
